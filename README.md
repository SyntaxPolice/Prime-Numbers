Algorithms from Prime Numbers, A Computational Perspective by Crandal and Pomerance

As a beginning, choose Algorithm 6.4.1 on page 304, the Index-calculus method for computing discrete logs in $F_p^\*$. 

This is a complicated algorithm which is dependant on several other algorithms in the book, such as a smoothness test and computing inverses modulo a prime. 


Here is a brief
